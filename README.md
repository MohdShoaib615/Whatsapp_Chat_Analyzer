# Whatsapp_Chat_Analyzer
In this Project , we can analyze our whatsapp chat like- total messages, words, links, media shared, most busiest user in the group, and various other analysis.


I have made this project in the Visual Code using the Streamlit library.

This can analyze our whatsapp chat on individual basis and group chat basis both.

Make sure while exporting the chats using whatsapp, the time-format should be 24 Hours.

The requirement of the libraries are:-
1-> streamlit

2-> pandas

3-> emoji

4-> matplotlib

5-> seaborn

6-> urlextract

7-> wordcloud
